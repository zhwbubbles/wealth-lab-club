      quote: "One conversation with Real kickstarted my crypto journey. Prior to signing up for his beginner course, my curiosity was peaking and my limited learnings came from scattered information on the web. I needed guidance and I needed to learn the basics. Real's Bitcoin & Crypto 101 Seminar gave me the education I needed to gain understanding, clarity and direction. Most importantly I gained the confidence to put plans into action. I've since formulated my own investment strategy and am now on the road to setting up my family for a successful future. I'm thankful and I highly recommend The Real Crypto Academy"
